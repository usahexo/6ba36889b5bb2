        <h1 id="ASU-Professor-Develops-Winning-Formula-for-State-Taxpayers"><a href="#ASU-Professor-Develops-Winning-Formula-for-State-Taxpayers" class="headerlink" title="ASU Professor Develops Winning Formula for State Taxpayers"></a>ASU Professor Develops Winning Formula for State Taxpayers</h1><p>Arizona State University (ASU) professor Stephen Slivinski has developed a winning formula for state taxpayers. The Arizona-based think tank Goldwater Institute reported this week that Professor Slivinski’s research shows the state could save up to $2.5 billion in taxes over the next decade by enacting a series of conservative spending and tax reforms.</p>
<p>Slivinski’s formula is based on the premise that government can live within its means while still providing needed services by reforming its spending and tax policies.</p>
<p>The report credits Slivinski with developing a “comprehensive plan that would reform state government, lower taxes and spur economic growth.” Highlights of the plan include: </p>
<ul>
<li>Moving from a two-tiered income tax system to a flat rate of 5.5 percent </li>
<li>Cutting regulations that are choking economic growth </li>
<li>Ending corporate welfare and other special-interest giveaways </li>
<li>Privatizing certain state functions </li>
<li>Consolidating duplicative government agencies </li>
<li>Repealing the state’s death tax</li>
</ul>
<p>“Arizona is finally on the cusp of significant change,” said Slivinski in a statement released by the Goldwater Institute. “This research provides policymakers with a roadmap to returning our state to fiscal health and ensuring that all Arizonans can benefit from economic opportunity.”</p>
<h1 id="Get-Ready-to-Claim-Your-Casino-Winnings-on-Your-AZ-State-Tax-Form"><a href="#Get-Ready-to-Claim-Your-Casino-Winnings-on-Your-AZ-State-Tax-Form" class="headerlink" title="Get Ready to Claim Your Casino Winnings on Your AZ State Tax Form"></a>Get Ready to Claim Your Casino Winnings on Your AZ State Tax Form</h1><p>It’s that time of year again where we all have to start filing our taxes. For many people, this also means claiming any casino winnings they may have earned over the past year. If you’re like most taxpayers, you’re probably wondering how exactly casino winnings are treated on your AZ state tax form.</p>
<p>Luckily, the good people at the Arizona Department of Revenue have put together a handy guide to help taxpayers understand just how their casino winnings are taxed. In short, casino winnings are considered taxable income in Arizona, and they must be included on your state tax return. However, taxpayers can claim a deduction for any gambling losses they incurred over the year.</p>
<p>So, how do you go about calculating your casino winnings for tax purposes? Well, it’s actually pretty simple. Just add up all of your winnings from each individual gambling activity, and then subtract any losses from that total. The net result is the amount of your casino winnings that you’ll need to report on your state tax return.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a little more detail, the Arizona Department of Revenue has provided a few examples to help illustrate how this works in practice. Let’s say John won $1,000 from blackjack at Casino A and lost $600 playing slots at Casino B. In this case, John’s taxable casino winnings would be $400 ($1,000 - $600).</p>
<p>Keep in mind that these rules only apply to casinos located in Arizona. If you won money from casinos located out-of-state, those winnings will be subject to federal taxation rules instead. So be sure to include any out-of-state casino earnings on your federal tax return as well.</p>
<p>Now that you know how casino winnings are taxed in AZ, it’s time to start filing your state tax return! Good luck and happy gambling!</p>
<h1 id="AZ-State-Tax-Form-Simplifies-Claiming-Casino-Winnings"><a href="#AZ-State-Tax-Form-Simplifies-Claiming-Casino-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="AZ State Tax Form Simplifies Claiming Casino Winnings"></a>AZ State Tax Form Simplifies Claiming Casino Winnings</h1><p>The Arizona Department of Revenue has released a new state tax form to simplify the process of claiming casino winnings. The updated Form 140N, Supplemental Income Tax Withholding Certificate, was created in response to the recent legalization of casino gambling in the state.</p>
<p>The form is designed to help taxpayers properly report their casino winnings income, as well as any associated withholding and make any necessary credit or deduction claims. The new form is available on the department’s website at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://azdor.gov/forms/supplemental-income-tax-withholding-certificate/">https://azdor.gov/forms/supplemental-income-tax-withholding-certificate/</a>.</p>
<p>Prior to the release of this new form, taxpayers were required to complete Schedule A and attach it to their annual personal income tax return. This often resulted in confusion over what should be reported on Schedule A and which forms and schedules were needed to file a complete return.</p>
<p>With the release of Form 140N, taxpayers will now only need to complete one form when reporting casino winnings. The form asks for basic information such as name, address, Social Security number, and total amount of winnings. It also includes sections for reporting withholdings and making credit or deduction claims.</p>
<p>Taxpayers are encouraged to review the instructions for Form 140N carefully before completing the form. The instructions provide detailed information on how to report withholdings, credits, and deductions related to casino winnings.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about how to report your casino winnings, please contact the Arizona Department of Revenue at (602) 542-4377 or visit our website at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://azdor.gov/">https://azdor.gov/</a>.</p>
<h1 id="What-You-Need-to-Know-About-the-Arizona-State-Tax-Form-for-Casino-Winnings"><a href="#What-You-Need-to-Know-About-the-Arizona-State-Tax-Form-for-Casino-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="What You Need to Know About the Arizona State Tax Form for Casino Winnings"></a>What You Need to Know About the Arizona State Tax Form for Casino Winnings</h1><p>When you win money while gambling in an Arizona casino, the amount is taxable. You must report your winnings on your Arizona state income tax return. The good news is that you may be able to claim a deduction for your losses. </p>
<p>To calculate your taxable casino winnings, you’ll need to know the amount of your winnings and the amount of your losses. Add the two together to get your net taxable casino winnings. </p>
<p>The amount of tax you owe on your casino winnings depends on your tax bracket. For example, if you’re in the 22% tax bracket, you would pay $22 in taxes for every $100 of taxable casino winnings. </p>
<p>You can claim a deduction for your losses, but only up to the amount of your taxable casino winnings. In other words, if you had $1,000 in taxable casino winnings and $1,500 in losses, you could only claim a deduction for $1,000. </p>
<p>There are a few other things to keep in mind when it comes to paying taxes on casino winnings: </p>
<ul>
<li>Winnings from bingo, keno and slot machines are all considered taxable income.</li>
<li>You must report all of your gambling income on your state income tax return, even if you didn’t itemize deductions on your federal return.</li>
<li>If you have questions about how to report your casino winnings, be sure to consult with a qualified tax professional.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Claim-Your-Casino-Winnings-on-Your-Arizona-State-Tax-Return"><a href="#Claim-Your-Casino-Winnings-on-Your-Arizona-State-Tax-Return" class="headerlink" title="Claim Your Casino Winnings on Your Arizona State Tax Return"></a>Claim Your Casino Winnings on Your Arizona State Tax Return</h1><p>If you’ve ever won money at a casino in Arizona, you may be wondering if you have to report those winnings on your state tax return. The answer is, it depends.</p>
<p>Generally, if you earn income from gambling, that income is taxable. However, there are some exceptions. For example, the state of Arizona does not tax the gambling income of residents who earn less than $600 per year from gambling. So, if you only gambled a little bit and didn’t earn much money from it, you don’t need to report those winnings on your state tax return.</p>
<p>But what if you earned more than $600 from gambling? In that case, you will need to report your gambling income on your state tax return. You can use Schedule A to report your gambling income and associated expenses. Be sure to include any winnings from casino slot machines, blackjack, roulette, and other table games.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about whether or not you need to report your casino winnings on your state tax return, be sure to contact a tax professional.</p>

This scene was shot at The Venetian in Las Vegas. The Venetian is a luxurious hotel and casino on the Las Vegas Strip. It is owned and operated by the Las Vegas Sands Corporation.</p>
<h1 id="MGM-Grand-casino-used-in-Oceans-13-for-Treasures-of-Egypt-game"><a href="#MGM-Grand-casino-used-in-Oceans-13-for-Treasures-of-Egypt-game" class="headerlink" title="MGM Grand casino used in Oceans 13 for Treasures of Egypt game"></a>MGM Grand casino used in Oceans 13 for Treasures of Egypt game</h1><p>The popular movie Oceans 13 was shot at the MGM Grand casino in Las Vegas. In one particular scene of the movie, the character Rusty Ryan uses a slot machine to try and win back money that was lost by the team. The game that is being played in the movie is called Treasures of Egypt, which is a real game that can be found at many casinos across the United States.</p>
<p>Treasures of Egypt is a five-reel slot machine with 20 paylines. The game has a desert theme, with symbols including an archaeologist, camels, pyramids, and treasure chests. The top prize in the game is worth 1,000 coins, which can be won by landing five archaeologist symbols on an active payline. There are also several bonus features available in the game, including free spins and a bonus round where players can win up to 50x their total bet.</p>
<p>If you want to experience the excitement of playing Treasures of Egypt yourself, head to your nearest casino and give it a try. You never know – you might just end up winning big like Rusty Ryan did in Oceans 13!</p>

<h1 id="How-to-win-at-the-Treasures-of-Egypt-game-in-Las-Vegas"><a href="#How-to-win-at-the-Treasures-of-Egypt-game-in-Las-Vegas" class="headerlink" title="How to win at the Treasures of Egypt game in Las Vegas"></a>How to win at the Treasures of Egypt game in Las Vegas</h1><p>Like most slot machines, the Treasures of Egypt game in Las Vegas is based on probability. There are a finite number of combinations that can be generated by the reels, and over time the house edge will gobble up a certain percentage of your bankroll. But there are ways to increase your chances of winning at this game and protect your bankroll.</p>
<p>One basic strategy is to bet on the same numbers each time. This limits the number of outcomes you need to consider when making your bet, and it also keeps the odds in your favor since every number has an equal chance of being hit. When it comes to progressive jackpot games, like Treasures of Egypt, it’s also important to bet max credits each time. This gives you the best chance of hitting the jackpot and winning big.</p>
<p>Another key factor in winning at Treasures of Egypt is to know when to walk away. Just like any other casino game, there’s no guarantee you’ll win every time you play. So make sure you have a healthy bankroll and don’t gamble more than you can afford to lose. If things start going bad, cut your losses and walk away – there will always be another chance to hit it big at the casino!</p>

The casino continued to operate, however, with no license.</p>
<p>Cougar Casino is owned by Evolution Gaming Ltd., a Malta-based company. The company is one of the largest and most respected providers of live dealer gaming services in the world.</p>
<p>According to the Commission on Gaming’s report, Cougar Casino “failed to demonstrate good corporate governance practices” and “failed to cooperate with the commission during the investigation.”</p>
<p>In a statement released to media, Evolution Gaming Ltd. said that it was “disappointed” with the decision of the commission and that it plans to “vigorously pursue all available legal remedies.”</p>
<p>The company also said that it believes it has “acted in good faith at all times.”</p>

<p>According to Pollard Banknote vice president of sales and marketing Randy Lichtman, Cougar Cash is a “one-of-a-kind game that offers players an engaging and exciting experience.”</p>
<p>The three-reel slot machine has five different bonus rounds, each with its own unique animated cougar character. Players can also win up to 10 free spins.</p>
<p>Pollard Banknote is one of the world’s leading suppliers of currency and gaming products, and has supplied over 1.5 billion tickets to North American lotteries over the past 25 years.</p>

<p>“We are excited to be able to offer our players the best gaming experience possible,” said Rouven Müller, CEO of Cougar Casino. “With the removal of slot machines we can focus on our live casino games which offer a much more interactive and engaging experience.”</p>

<p>The pair obtained the license in late 2014, and started to see profits roll in soon after. With a clear focus on customer satisfaction and security, Cougar Casino has quickly become a favored destination for online gamblers from around the world.</p>
<p>The success of the casino can be largely attributed to the owners’ passion for the industry, as well as their dedication to providing an excellent customer experience. “We’re always looking for new ways to improve our site and make it more user-friendly,” commented Damien. “And we make sure that our games are fair and secure, so players can enjoy themselves without worrying about cheating or fraud.”</p>
<p>The well-run casino is also licensed by the reputable Malta Gaming Authority, which only adds to its credibility with customers. “MGA is one of the most respected licensing bodies in the world, so it was important for us to get their approval,” said Tyler. “We want our players to feel confident that we’re a serious business with high standards.”</p>
<p>The gamble has certainly paid off for Damien and Tyler, who are now enjoying a very comfortable lifestyle thanks to their successful online casino venture.

        <h1 id="No-Minimum-Age-for-Kansas-Casinos"><a href="#No-Minimum-Age-for-Kansas-Casinos" class="headerlink" title="No Minimum Age for Kansas Casinos"></a>No Minimum Age for Kansas Casinos</h1><p>Kansas casinos no minimum age requirement for casino gaming has become a popular destination for tourists and gamers from neighboring states. Nearby states have a minimum legal gambling age of 21, while there is no such requirement in Kansas. The allure of easy access to casinos has drawn many people to the state, including underage gamblers.</p>
<p>The legality of underage gambling at Kansas casinos has come into question, as state law does not clearly define when someone is considered to be an adult. Two recent cases in which minors were caught gambling at a casino have stirred up the debate over whether or not the state should set a minimum age for casino gaming.</p>
<p>In one case, a 17-year-old was caught gambling at a casino in Wichita. The minor was issued a citation and released to his parents. In the other case, a 19-year-old was arrested after he was caught cheating at blackjack in a casino in Dodge City. The young man was taken into custody and later released on bond.</p>
<p>Casino operators argue that setting a minimum age would be discriminatory, as it would prevent minors from participating in lawful activities at casinos along with adults. However, opponents of underage gambling say that casinos are not suitable environments for minors and that the state should do more to protect them from developing addictions to gambling.</p>
<p>A bill that would have set the minimum age for casino gaming at 18 failed to make it out of committee during the most recent legislative session. The issue is likely to be debated again next year, as lawmakers continue to search for ways to address the growing popularity of Kansas casinos.</p>
<h1 id="You-must-be-18-to-gamble-in-Kansas-casinos"><a href="#You-must-be-18-to-gamble-in-Kansas-casinos" class="headerlink" title="You must be 18 to gamble in Kansas casinos"></a>You must be 18 to gamble in Kansas casinos</h1><p>Kansas has a number of casinos, and as of November 1, 2018, you must be 18 years old to gamble in them. If you are not yet 18, there are still plenty of other fun things to do in Kansas casinos!</p>
<p>Many people think that the only thing to do in a casino is gamble, but that’s not the case at all. Casinos often have restaurants, lounges, nightclubs, and more. You can also find shopping and entertainment options at some casinos. So whether you’re looking to gamble or just have some fun, there’s something for you at Kansas casinos!</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a place to stay overnight, many casinos offer hotel rooms. You can also find RV parks and campgrounds near some of the larger casinos. And don’t forget that Kansas is home to some great natural attractions like Mount Sunflower and Monument Rocks National Monument – so be sure to check those out while you’re in the state.</p>

<h1 id="Kansas-Casinos-No-Minimum-Age-To-Play"><a href="#Kansas-Casinos-No-Minimum-Age-To-Play" class="headerlink" title="Kansas Casinos: No Minimum Age To Play"></a>Kansas Casinos: No Minimum Age To Play</h1><p>Gambling has always been a popular pastime, and there are plenty of different ways to gamble. You can visit a casino, race track, or bingo hall, or you can place a bet on a sporting event. Gambling is also available online, and you can even gamble using your phone.</p>
<p>One of the most popular forms of gambling is playing the slots. Slot machines are available in virtually every casino, and they are also available online. Slot machines are very simple to play. All you have to do is put money in the machine, and then hit the button or pull the lever to start spinning the reels.</p>
<p>There is no minimum age to play slot machines in Kansas casinos. In fact, there is no minimum age to gamble in Kansas casinos at all. This means that even children can gamble in Kansas casinos as long as they are accompanied by an adult.</p>
<p>While there is no minimum age to play slots in Kansas casinos, there is a minimum age to gamble in other forms of casino games. For example, the minimum age to gamble in blackjack is 21. This means that you must be 21 years old or older to participate in blackjack games at Kansas casinos.</p>
<p>The reason for this difference is that blackjack is a skill game. Slot machines are considered luck games, and there is no skill involved. Therefore, it is not necessary to be 21 years old or older to play slots in Kansas casinos.</p>
<h1 id="In-Kansas-You-Can-Gamble-at-Any-Age"><a href="#In-Kansas-You-Can-Gamble-at-Any-Age" class="headerlink" title="In Kansas, You Can Gamble at Any Age"></a>In Kansas, You Can Gamble at Any Age</h1><p>It’s no secret that in the United States, there are age restrictions on when you can gamble. For example, in California, you must be at least 21 years old to gamble in a casino. However, there are a few exceptions to this rule, and one of them is Kansas.</p>
<p>In Kansas, you can gamble at any age. This is because there are no age restrictions on gambling in the state constitution. So, whether you’re a young adult or an senior citizen, you can enjoy games of chance at any casino in Kansas.</p>
<p>This makes Kansas a popular destination for gambling enthusiasts of all ages. And with so many casinos located throughout the state, there’s something for everyone. Whether you’re looking for big-city excitement or small-town charm, you can find it in Kansas.</p>
<p>So if you’re looking for a place to gamble where the minimum age is zero, Kansas is your best bet!</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Gambling-in-Kansas-No-Minimum-Age"><a href="#Casino-Gambling-in-Kansas-No-Minimum-Age" class="headerlink" title="Casino Gambling in Kansas: No Minimum Age!"></a>Casino Gambling in Kansas: No Minimum Age!</h1><p>Casino gambling is a popular form of entertainment, and many people enjoy gambling in Kansas without any restrictions. Unlike some states, there is no minimum age requirement to gamble in a casino in Kansas. This means that any person over the age of 18 can legally gamble at any of the casinos in the state.</p>
<p>This has led to some controversy, as many people feel that casino gambling should be restricted to those over the age of 21. However, supporters of unrestricted gambling argue that it is up to each individual to make their own decisions about whether or not to gamble, and that there is no justification for limiting this form of entertainment to a specific age group.</p>
<p>Regardless of where you stand on this issue, it is important to be aware that there are no age restrictions for casino gambling in Kansas. If you are planning a trip to one of the casinos in the state, be sure to bring your ID and be prepared to gamble responsibly.</p>

DOES THIS MEAN THE END OF CLASH OF GODS?"></a>WHEN DID BINIONS CASINO CLOSE? DOES THIS MEAN THE END OF CLASH OF GODS?</h1><p>The Binions casino closed in February of 2019, leaving many in the poker community wondering what this means for the future of Clash of Gods.</p>
<p>Clash of Gods is a popular poker tournament that has been held at the Binions casino for years. The tournament was canceled after the casino closed, and it is not clear if it will be held again.</p>
<p>Some people are speculating that the closure of the casino means the end of Clash of Gods. However, there is no evidence to support this claim.</p>
<p>It is possible that the tournament will be moved to another venue, or that it will be canceled altogether. Only time will tell.</p>
<h1 id="CLASH-OF-GODS-GAME-ON-HOLD-AFTER-BINIONS-CASINO-CLOSES-DOWN"><a href="#CLASH-OF-GODS-GAME-ON-HOLD-AFTER-BINIONS-CASINO-CLOSES-DOWN" class="headerlink" title="CLASH OF GODS GAME ON HOLD AFTER BINIONS CASINO CLOSES DOWN"></a>CLASH OF GODS GAME ON HOLD AFTER BINIONS CASINO CLOSES DOWN</h1><p>The much anticipated Clash of Gods game tournament at Binions Casino in Las Vegas has been postponed indefinitely after the casino unexpectedly closed its doors this week.</p>
<p>The closure of Binions Casino has caused a lot of upset among gamblers and casino staff alike, with many employees losing their jobs. The future of the casino remains uncertain, with rumours that it may be sold to another company.</p>
<p>The postponement of the Clash of Gods tournament has left many players disappointed. The tournament was expected to be one of the highlights of the gambling calendar, with top players from all over the world competing for a $1 million prize pool.</p>
<p>Some players have already started looking for other tournaments to enter, but most are just waiting for news about when or if the tournament will take place. There is no clear answer yet as to when or where the tournament will be held, but officials from Caesars Entertainment Corporation, which is organizing the event, say they are doing everything they can to find a new venue.</p>
<p>In a statement released this week, a spokesperson for Caesars Entertainment Corporation said: “We are deeply sorry for any inconvenience that this situation may have caused our players. We are doing everything we can to find a new venue and get the tournament back on track as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>The Clash of Gods tournament was originally scheduled to take place from April 21-24 at Binions Casino.</p>
<h1 id="BINIONS-CASINO-CLOSURE-RAISES-QUESTIONS-ABOUT-FUTURE-OF-CLASH-OF-GODS"><a href="#BINIONS-CASINO-CLOSURE-RAISES-QUESTIONS-ABOUT-FUTURE-OF-CLASH-OF-GODS" class="headerlink" title="BINIONS CASINO CLOSURE RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT FUTURE OF CLASH OF GODS"></a>BINIONS CASINO CLOSURE RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT FUTURE OF CLASH OF GODS</h1><p>On Monday, news broke that Binions Casino in downtown Las Vegas would be closing its doors for good on May 15th. The closure has sent ripples through the city’s casino industry, as well as the wider world of online gaming.</p>
<p>The news comes as a particular surprise given that Binions has been a fixture of the downtown landscape for over 80 years. The closure is all the more puzzling because it coincides with the debut of Clash of Gods, a new online casino that has been heavily marketed as a revitalization of the Las Vegas gaming scene.</p>
<p>Officials at Binions have not yet released a statement explaining the closure, but industry insiders are already speculating about the reasons behind it. Some believe that the casino may have been struggling financially, while others suggest that there may have been disagreements among management about how to move forward in light of Clash of Gods’ arrival.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason for the closure, it is certain to have a major impact on both Binions and Clash of Gods. For Binions, it means losing one of its most iconic properties; for Clash of Gods, it means potentially losing out on one of its main competition venues.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how both businesses adapt in the coming weeks and months. In particular, Clash of Gods will need to find a way to make up for the significant revenue that Binions was likely generating.</p>
<h1 id="CLASH-OF-GODS-GAME-MAY-BE-IN-JEOPARDY-FOLLOWING-BINIONS-CASINO-CLOSURE"><a href="#CLASH-OF-GODS-GAME-MAY-BE-IN-JEOPARDY-FOLLOWING-BINIONS-CASINO-CLOSURE" class="headerlink" title="CLASH OF GODS GAME MAY BE IN JEOPARDY FOLLOWING BINIONS CASINO CLOSURE"></a>CLASH OF GODS GAME MAY BE IN JEOPARDY FOLLOWING BINIONS CASINO CLOSURE</h1><p>The closure of the Binions casino in downtown Las Vegas may have dealt a fatal blow to the development of Clash of Gods, a new online slot game based on Norse mythology.</p>
<p>The $17 million game, which was being developed by local video game company PlaynGo, had been in production for over two years and was scheduled for release this summer. However, the closure of the casino has put the project on hold.</p>
<p>“We’re in a holding pattern right now,” said PlaynGo CEO Johan Tornqvist. “We’re waiting to see what happens with the casino.”</p>
<p>Binions closed its doors on March 14th after its owner, Galt Gaming, filed for bankruptcy. The closure left over 1,000 employees without jobs and put the future of other businesses that operate in the casino, including Clash of Gods, in doubt.</p>
<p>Galt Gaming is currently in negotiations with two potential buyers for the casino but no deal has been reached yet. If a deal is not reached soon, Clash of Gods may never see the light of day.</p>
<h1 id="BINIONS-CASINO-SHUTDOWN-HURTING-FREE-TO-PLAY-GAME-CLASH-OF-GODS"><a href="#BINIONS-CASINO-SHUTDOWN-HURTING-FREE-TO-PLAY-GAME-CLASH-OF-GODS" class="headerlink" title="BINIONS CASINO SHUTDOWN HURTING FREE-TO-PLAY GAME, CLASH OF GODS"></a>BINIONS CASINO SHUTDOWN HURTING FREE-TO-PLAY GAME, CLASH OF GODS</h1><p>The closure of Binions Casino in downtown Las Vegas is having a ripple effect on the free-to-play game, Clash of Gods. The game’s developer, EGO, has seen a decrease in active users since the casino closed its doors in early May.</p>
<p>EGO has been unable to determine the specific cause of the drop in users, but believes that the closure of Binions is a major contributing factor. Located just one block from EGO’s headquarters, the casino was a major player in the game’s user base.</p>
<p>Clash of Gods is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game that allows players to control mythological gods and warriors from different pantheons. The game has been downloaded over 5 million times and has generated over $100 million in revenue since its release in 2017.</p>
<p>In a statement released to the press, EGO CEO Amir Goldstein said “We are disappointed by the closure of Binions and its impact on our business. However, we remain committed to our players and will continue to develop new content and features for Clash of Gods.”</p>
<p>Clash of Gods is currently available on iOS and Android devices.</p>
