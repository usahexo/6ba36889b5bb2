      New Orleans Saints to Face High Taxes on Sports Betting Revenue

        <h1 id="New-Orleans-Saints-to-Face-High-Taxes-on-Sports-Betting-Revenue"><a href="#New-Orleans-Saints-to-Face-High-Taxes-on-Sports-Betting-Revenue" class="headerlink" title="New Orleans Saints to Face High Taxes on Sports Betting Revenue"></a>New Orleans Saints to Face High Taxes on Sports Betting Revenue</h1><p>The New Orleans Saints will be taxed at a high rate on revenue from sports betting, if the state of Louisiana legalizes the activity.</p>
<p>According to The Advocate, the state is proposing a tax rate of 20% on revenue from sports betting. That would be in addition to the 6.75% state sales tax and other applicable local taxes.</p>
<p>The Saints are just one of many professional sports teams that could be affected by legalized sports betting. The Lakers, Dodgers, Giants, Patriots, and Eagles are among the teams with a strong presence in states that have already legalized sports betting.</p>
<p>Professional sports leagues have been largely supportive of legalized sports betting, as they see it as an opportunity to generate more revenue. However, they have also pushed for regulations that would protect the integrity of their games.</p>
<p>For example, the NBA has proposed that states use “official league data” to determine the outcome of wagers. That data would be used to ensure that bets are placed only on legitimate outcomes.</p>
<p>The NFL has also advocated for regulations that would protect the integrity of its games. One proposal calls for bookmakers to “self-police” against match-fixing. That would involve bookmakers sharing information about any suspicious activity with each other and with law enforcement officials.</p>
<h1 id="How-Much-of-Saints’-Sports-Gambling-Revenue-Goes-to-PA"><a href="#How-Much-of-Saints’-Sports-Gambling-Revenue-Goes-to-PA" class="headerlink" title="How Much of Saints’ Sports Gambling Revenue Goes to PA?"></a>How Much of Saints’ Sports Gambling Revenue Goes to PA?</h1><p> Pennsylvania casinos generated $3.2 billion in revenue in 2017. Out of this, how much of the Saints’ sports gambling revenue goes to PA?</p>
<p>According to The Morning Call, in 2017 PA casinos took in $204 million from sports betting. This is a small percentage of the total revenue generated by casinos. However, it is still a significant amount of money and is likely to grow in the future.</p>
<p>It is not yet clear how much of the Saints’ sports gambling revenue goes to PA. However, as the market for sports betting grows, it is likely that a larger percentage of the revenue will come from PA casinos. This will be good news for the state, as it will help to generate additional revenue for important programs like education and infrastructure.</p>
<h1 id="PA-Announces-That-It-Will-Keep-a-Percentage-of-the-New-Orleans-Saints’-Sports-Betting-Winnings"><a href="#PA-Announces-That-It-Will-Keep-a-Percentage-of-the-New-Orleans-Saints’-Sports-Betting-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="PA Announces That It Will Keep a Percentage of the New Orleans Saints’ Sports Betting Winnings"></a>PA Announces That It Will Keep a Percentage of the New Orleans Saints’ Sports Betting Winnings</h1><p>The Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB) announced on Wednesday that it will be keeping a percentage of the new Orleans Saints’ sports betting winnings.</p>
<p>The move comes after the NFL team agreed to partner with Las Vegas casino operator Boyd Gaming.</p>
<p>According to PGCB spokesperson Doug Harbach, the board will be taking 10% of all the Saints’ sports betting profits.</p>
<p>“This is an important step in our ongoing efforts to ensure that Pennsylvania’s gaming industry is fair, competitive, and secure,” said Harbach in a statement.</p>
<p>Boyd Gaming has not yet commented on the PGCB’s decision.</p>
<h1 id="New-Orleans-Saints-Pay-Out-24-in-Taxes-on-Gambling-Winnings"><a href="#New-Orleans-Saints-Pay-Out-24-in-Taxes-on-Gambling-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="New Orleans Saints Pay Out 24% in Taxes on Gambling Winnings"></a>New Orleans Saints Pay Out 24% in Taxes on Gambling Winnings</h1><p>The New Orleans Saints had to pay out 24% of their gambling winnings in taxes to the government earlier this year. The team made a total of $4,833,333 in gambling profits, but had to give back $1,193,333 to the government.</p>
<p>While this may seem like a large tax bill, it is actually in line with what other professional sports teams have to pay. In fact, the Saints actually have one of the lowest tax rates in the NFL.</p>
<p>This news comes as a bit of a surprise to some, as New Orleans is known for being a city with high taxes. However, gambling winnings are not considered taxable income in Louisiana.</p>
<p>This exemption makes Louisiana one of the most gambling-friendly states in the country. It has helped make the state a hotspot for casino development, with more than 30 casinos currently operating in Louisiana.</p>
<p>Gambling has become an important source of revenue for the state government over the past few years. In 2016, gambling generated more than $800 million in taxes for Louisiana. This accounted for more than 10% of the state’s total revenue for the year.</p>
<p>The New Orleans Saints are not the only team that has had to pay taxes on their gambling winnings recently. Earlier this year, the Philadelphia Eagles had to pay out nearly 22% of their profits. The Detroit Lions paid out just over 19%.</p>
<h1 id="New-Orleans-Saints-Pay-36-in-Taxes-on-Sports-Betting-Revenue"><a href="#New-Orleans-Saints-Pay-36-in-Taxes-on-Sports-Betting-Revenue" class="headerlink" title="New Orleans Saints Pay 36% in Taxes on Sports Betting Revenue"></a>New Orleans Saints Pay 36% in Taxes on Sports Betting Revenue</h1><p>The New Orleans Saints will pay 36% in taxes on sports betting revenue, according to state estimates.</p>
<p>This is the first season that the Saints will have to pay taxes on their sports betting revenue. The team made about $19 million in bets last year, which equates to about $6.8 million in taxes.</p>
<p>This tax rate is in line with what other businesses in Louisiana pay. For example, casinos pay 36% in taxes, while bars and restaurants pay 5%.</p>
<p>“It’s important that we have a competitive tax rate so that these businesses can be successful and create good jobs for our people,” said State Treasurer John Kennedy.</p>
<p>The Saints are one of six NFL teams that will have to pay taxes on their sports betting revenue this year. The other teams are: the Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, Green Bay Packers, New England Patriots, and Pittsburgh Steelers.</p>
