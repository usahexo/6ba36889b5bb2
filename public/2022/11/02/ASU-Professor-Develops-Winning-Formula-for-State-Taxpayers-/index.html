The Arizona-based think tank Goldwater Institute reported this week that Professor Slivinski’s research shows the state could save up to $2.5 billion in taxes over the next decade by enacting a series of conservative spending and tax reforms.</p>
<p>Slivinski’s formula is based on the premise that government can live within its means while still providing needed services by reforming its spending and tax policies.</p>
<p>The report credits Slivinski with developing a “comprehensive plan that would reform state government, lower taxes and spur economic growth.” Highlights of the plan include: </p>
<ul>
<li>Moving from a two-tiered income tax system to a flat rate of 5.5 percent </li>
<li>Cutting regulations that are choking economic growth </li>
<li>Ending corporate welfare and other special-interest giveaways </li>
<li>Privatizing certain state functions </li>
<li>Consolidating duplicative government agencies </li>
<li>Repealing the state’s death tax</li>
</ul>
<p>“Arizona is finally on the cusp of significant change,” said Slivinski in a statement released by the Goldwater Institute. “This research provides policymakers with a roadmap to returning our state to fiscal health and ensuring that all Arizonans can benefit from economic opportunity.”</p>
<h1 id="Get-Ready-to-Claim-Your-Casino-Winnings-on-Your-AZ-State-Tax-Form"><a href="#Get-Ready-to-Claim-Your-Casino-Winnings-on-Your-AZ-State-Tax-Form" class="headerlink" title="Get Ready to Claim Your Casino Winnings on Your AZ State Tax Form"></a>Get Ready to Claim Your Casino Winnings on Your AZ State Tax Form</h1><p>It’s that time of year again where we all have to start filing our taxes. For many people, this also means claiming any casino winnings they may have earned over the past year. If you’re like most taxpayers, you’re probably wondering how exactly casino winnings are treated on your AZ state tax form.</p>
<p>Luckily, the good people at the Arizona Department of Revenue have put together a handy guide to help taxpayers understand just how their casino winnings are taxed. In short, casino winnings are considered taxable income in Arizona, and they must be included on your state tax return. However, taxpayers can claim a deduction for any gambling losses they incurred over the year.</p>
<p>So, how do you go about calculating your casino winnings for tax purposes? Well, it’s actually pretty simple. Just add up all of your winnings from each individual gambling activity, and then subtract any losses from that total. The net result is the amount of your casino winnings that you’ll need to report on your state tax return.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a little more detail, the Arizona Department of Revenue has provided a few examples to help illustrate how this works in practice. Let’s say John won $1,000 from blackjack at Casino A and lost $600 playing slots at Casino B. In this case, John’s taxable casino winnings would be $400 ($1,000 - $600).</p>
<p>Keep in mind that these rules only apply to casinos located in Arizona. If you won money from casinos located out-of-state, those winnings will be subject to federal taxation rules instead. So be sure to include any out-of-state casino earnings on your federal tax return as well.</p>
<p>Now that you know how casino winnings are taxed in AZ, it’s time to start filing your state tax return! Good luck and happy gambling!</p>
<h1 id="AZ-State-Tax-Form-Simplifies-Claiming-Casino-Winnings"><a href="#AZ-State-Tax-Form-Simplifies-Claiming-Casino-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="AZ State Tax Form Simplifies Claiming Casino Winnings"></a>AZ State Tax Form Simplifies Claiming Casino Winnings</h1><p>The Arizona Department of Revenue has released a new state tax form to simplify the process of claiming casino winnings. The updated Form 140N, Supplemental Income Tax Withholding Certificate, was created in response to the recent legalization of casino gambling in the state.</p>
<p>The form is designed to help taxpayers properly report their casino winnings income, as well as any associated withholding and make any necessary credit or deduction claims. The new form is available on the department’s website at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://azdor.gov/forms/supplemental-income-tax-withholding-certificate/">https://azdor.gov/forms/supplemental-income-tax-withholding-certificate/</a>.</p>
<p>Prior to the release of this new form, taxpayers were required to complete Schedule A and attach it to their annual personal income tax return. This often resulted in confusion over what should be reported on Schedule A and which forms and schedules were needed to file a complete return.</p>
<p>With the release of Form 140N, taxpayers will now only need to complete one form when reporting casino winnings. The form asks for basic information such as name, address, Social Security number, and total amount of winnings. It also includes sections for reporting withholdings and making credit or deduction claims.</p>
<p>Taxpayers are encouraged to review the instructions for Form 140N carefully before completing the form. The instructions provide detailed information on how to report withholdings, credits, and deductions related to casino winnings.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about how to report your casino winnings, please contact the Arizona Department of Revenue at (602) 542-4377 or visit our website at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://azdor.gov/">https://azdor.gov/</a>.</p>

You must report your winnings on your Arizona state income tax return. The good news is that you may be able to claim a deduction for your losses. </p>
<p>To calculate your taxable casino winnings, you’ll need to know the amount of your winnings and the amount of your losses. Add the two together to get your net taxable casino winnings. </p>
<p>The amount of tax you owe on your casino winnings depends on your tax bracket. For example, if you’re in the 22% tax bracket, you would pay $22 in taxes for every $100 of taxable casino winnings. </p>
<p>You can claim a deduction for your losses, but only up to the amount of your taxable casino winnings. In other words, if you had $1,000 in taxable casino winnings and $1,500 in losses, you could only claim a deduction for $1,000. </p>
<p>There are a few other things to keep in mind when it comes to paying taxes on casino winnings: </p>
<ul>
<li>Winnings from bingo, keno and slot machines are all considered taxable income.</li>
<li>You must report all of your gambling income on your state income tax return, even if you didn’t itemize deductions on your federal return.</li>
<li>If you have questions about how to report your casino winnings, be sure to consult with a qualified tax professional.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Claim-Your-Casino-Winnings-on-Your-Arizona-State-Tax-Return"><a href="#Claim-Your-Casino-Winnings-on-Your-Arizona-State-Tax-Return" class="headerlink" title="Claim Your Casino Winnings on Your Arizona State Tax Return"></a>Claim Your Casino Winnings on Your Arizona State Tax Return</h1><p>If you’ve ever won money at a casino in Arizona, you may be wondering if you have to report those winnings on your state tax return. The answer is, it depends.</p>
<p>Generally, if you earn income from gambling, that income is taxable. However, there are some exceptions. For example, the state of Arizona does not tax the gambling income of residents who earn less than $600 per year from gambling. So, if you only gambled a little bit and didn’t earn much money from it, you don’t need to report those winnings on your state tax return.</p>
<p>But what if you earned more than $600 from gambling? In that case, you will need to report your gambling income on your state tax return. You can use Schedule A to report your gambling income and associated expenses. Be sure to include any winnings from casino slot machines, blackjack, roulette, and other table games.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about whether or not you need to report your casino winnings on your state tax return, be sure to contact a tax professional.</p>
