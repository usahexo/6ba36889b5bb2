When it comes to charitable giving, there are a few important things to keep in mind.</p>
<p>For one, how much money do you have to give away?  Secondly, what kind of charity does your money support?  And finally, where does the rest of your income come from?</p>
<p>Assuming you are financially comfortable and have enough money to give away sizable chunks at a time, let’s take a look at some popular donation options and see how much good your money could do.</p>
<p>A few examples:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>A donation of $10 can provide clean water for one person for 10 years through a charity such as Charity: Water .</p>
</li>
<li><p>$25 can provide vaccinations for 50 children through the UNICEF vaccination campaign .</p>
</li>
<li><p>$100 can support an endangered animal for one year through programs like the WWF .</p>
</li>
<li><p>$250 can send a girl to school for one year through organizations like Girl Rising .</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These are just a few examples, but they illustrate the point that even small donations can make a big impact in the world. With so many worthy causes out there, it can be tough to decide where to donate your money. But that’s okay – sometimes it’s good to spread the love around!</p>
<h1 id="Giving-Away-Winnings-Can-Result-In-Major-Tax-Savings"><a href="#Giving-Away-Winnings-Can-Result-In-Major-Tax-Savings" class="headerlink" title="Giving Away Winnings Can Result In Major Tax Savings"></a>Giving Away Winnings Can Result In Major Tax Savings</h1><p>When you receive taxable winnings, such as from gambling or a lottery, you generally must pay income tax on the money. However, there are several ways to reduce or avoid paying taxes on your winnings.</p>
<p>One way is to simply give the money away. If you give away at least $13,000 in a year, it can be considered a deductible charitable contribution. This means that you can deduct the amount of the contribution from your taxable income, which can save you quite a bit of money in taxes.</p>
<p>For example, if you earned $50,000 in taxable income last year and donated $13,000 to charity, you would only have to report $37,000 in taxable income on your return. This would save you over $2,500 in taxes.</p>
<p>There are a few things to keep in mind when giving away your winnings. First, the contribution must be made to a qualified charity. You can find a list of qualified charities on the IRS website.</p>
<p>Second, you cannot claim a deduction for any amount of your donation that was already tax-deductible. For example, if you bought tickets to a charity dinner for $200 and then donated them for $100, you could only claim a deduction for $100.</p>
<p>Third, you cannot take a deduction for any amount of your donation that exceeds 50% of your adjusted gross income (AGI). So, if your AGI is $50,000 and you donate $25,000 to charity, you can only claim a deduction for $12,500 ($25,000 x 50% &#x3D; $12,500).</p>
<p>Finally, keep in mind that these rules are subject to change by Congress at any time. Make sure to talk with an accountant or tax specialist if you have any questions about how giving away your winnings could affect your tax situation.</p>
<h1 id="Could-Your-Business-Benefit-From-A-LumpSum-Donation"><a href="#Could-Your-Business-Benefit-From-A-LumpSum-Donation" class="headerlink" title="Could Your Business Benefit From A LumpSum Donation?"></a>Could Your Business Benefit From A LumpSum Donation?</h1><p>Making a donation to charity is a great way to help out a good cause and feel good about yourself. However, your business may also be able to benefit from charitable donations. Here are a few things to keep in mind if you’re thinking of making a lump sum donation to charity:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tax Benefits</li>
</ol>
<p>Donating money or goods to charity can provide businesses with some tax benefits. For example, the amount of money you donate may be tax deductible. When donating goods, you may be able to write off the fair market value of the items on your taxes. Be sure to speak with an accountant or tax professional to learn more about the specific benefits available to you.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Donor Recognition</li>
</ol>
<p>Donating money or goods to charity can also help promote your business as a responsible and charitable member of the community. Many donors receive public recognition for their contributions, which can be great for marketing purposes.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Boost Employee Morale</li>
</ol>
<p>Donating money or goods to charity can also boost employee morale. Employees often appreciate businesses that give back to the community in this way. Knowing that their employer is helping those in need can make employees feel good about their job and proud to work for such a responsible company.</p>
<p>If you’re thinking of making a lump sum donation to charity, there are a few things you should keep in mind. Tax benefits, donor recognition, and employee morale are all potential benefits of charitable giving. Talk with an accountant or tax professional to learn more about how your business can benefit from making a donation and be sure to promote your generosity among your staff!</p>
<h1 id="Charitable-Contributions-Can-Help-Lower-Your-Taxable-Income"><a href="#Charitable-Contributions-Can-Help-Lower-Your-Taxable-Income" class="headerlink" title="Charitable Contributions Can Help Lower Your Taxable Income"></a>Charitable Contributions Can Help Lower Your Taxable Income</h1><p>When it comes to your taxes, every little bit helps. That’s especially true when it comes to charitable contributions.</p>
<p>Here are four ways that charitable contributions can help lower your taxable income:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The first way is through deductions. You can deduct the amount of your charitable contribution from your taxable income. This can be a big help if you itemize your deductions rather than taking the standard deduction. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Another way charitable contributions can lower your taxable income is by giving you a tax break on the money you donate. For example, if you donate money to a charity that’s considered a “qualified charity,” you can get a tax break of up to 50% of your donation. </p>
</li>
<li><p>A third way charitable contributions can help reduce your taxable income is if you donate property instead of cash. In this case, you may be able to deduct the fair market value of the property from your taxable income. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Finally, one more way that charitable contributions can help reduce your taxable income is if you make them in lieu of other payments. For example, if you would normally have to pay taxes on $10,000 in wages but instead donate $10,000 to a charity, you can avoid paying taxes on that money altogether.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As you can see, there are plenty of ways that charitable contributions can help reduce your taxable income. So next time tax season rolls around, don’t forget to include all of your donations!</p>
<h1 id="How-To-Claim-A-Gambling-Loss-On-Your-Taxes"><a href="#How-To-Claim-A-Gambling-Loss-On-Your-Taxes" class="headerlink" title="How To Claim A Gambling Loss On Your Taxes"></a>How To Claim A Gambling Loss On Your Taxes</h1><p>If you gamble and have losses, you may be able to claim them on your taxes. Here is a guide on how to claim a gambling loss on your taxes.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Determine your gambling income. This includes winnings from lotteries, raffles, horse races, and casinos. It also includes cash and the fair market value of any non-cash prizes you receive.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Subtract your gambling losses from your gambling income. This will give you your net gambling income.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Report your net gambling income on line 21 of form 1040, line 10 of form 1040A, or line 5 of form 1040NR.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you itemize deductions, you can also deduct your losses on Schedule A as a miscellaneous deduction. The amount you can deduct is limited to the amount of income shown on line 21 of Form 1040, line 10 of Form 1040A, or line 5 of Form 1040NR minus $3,000 for the tax year 2018 ($2,000 for tax years 2009-2017).</p>
</li>
<li><p>To claim your deduction, attach Schedule A (Form 1040) to your return. Write “GAMBLING LOSSES” at the top of Schedule A.</p>
</li>
</ol>
