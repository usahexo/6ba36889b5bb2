From casinos in Las Vegas and Atlantic City to lotteries and race tracks, we have all sorts of ways to risk our money. Unfortunately, when it comes time to pay up, many people find themselves in debt.</p>
<p>In fact, according to a study by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), nearly half of all American adults have gambled in the last 12 months, and nearly one-third have owed money to a gambling outlet.</p>
<p>Of those who owed money, the average amount owed was $1,735. And while most people were able to pay off their debt within a year, nearly one-fifth still owed money after two years.</p>
<p>If you find yourself in this situation, don’t worry - you’re not alone. But you do need to take action quickly, because the longer you wait, the more interest you’ll accrue.</p>
<p>Here are a few tips for dealing with gambling debt:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Assess your situation. The first step is to take a look at your financial situation and determine how much debt you actually owe. This may be difficult to do on your own, so consider working with a financial advisor or credit counseling service.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Create a budget. Once you know how much debt you owe, you need to create a budget that allows you to pay it off over time. This may mean making some sacrifices in terms of your lifestyle or spending habits.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Contact your creditors. Next, contact your creditors and let them know what’s going on. Many will be willing to work with you to come up with a payment plan that fits your budget.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Get help if needed. If you find that you’re struggling to manage your gambling debt on your own, get help from a qualified professional. There are many organizations that can provide assistance, including the National Council on Problem Gambling and Gamblers Anonymous.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="Gambling-Debt-Could-Cost-You-Your-Home"><a href="#Gambling-Debt-Could-Cost-You-Your-Home" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Debt Could Cost You Your Home"></a>Gambling Debt Could Cost You Your Home</h1><p>A recent study by the Carnegie Mellon University has found that gambling debt is the number one cause of bankruptcy in the United States.</p>
<p>The study, which was conducted over a period of 25 years, showed that 40 percent of bankruptcy filings were caused by unpaid gambling debts. This was more than any other type of debt, including medical bills and credit card debt.</p>
<p>The study also found that bankruptcy rates are significantly higher for people who gamble more often. In fact, the bankruptcy rate for those who gambled every week was seven times higher than for those who didn’t gamble at all.</p>
<p>This isn’t too surprising when you consider how easy it is to get into debt when you’re gambling. Most casinos allow you to bet as little as $1, and they have a wide variety of games available, including slots, blackjack, and roulette. This means that it’s easy to lose a lot of money very quickly if you’re not careful.</p>
<p>If you’re struggling with gambling debt, there are a few things you can do to help get yourself back on track:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Create a budget and stick to it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Talk to your creditors and see if they’re willing to work with you on a payment plan.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Seek counseling or treatment for addiction if necessary.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Find support from friends or family members who can help keep you accountable.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’re struggling with gambling debt, don’t hesitate to reach out for help. There are organizations available that can provide support and guidance, and there are also many helpful articles and websites online that can offer advice. Don’t try to tackle this problem on your own - it’s much easier to overcome when you have help from others.</p>
<h1 id="You-Could-Go-to-Jail-for-Not-Paying-Your-Gambling-Debt"><a href="#You-Could-Go-to-Jail-for-Not-Paying-Your-Gambling-Debt" class="headerlink" title="You Could Go to Jail for Not Paying Your Gambling Debt"></a>You Could Go to Jail for Not Paying Your Gambling Debt</h1><p>Debtors’ prisons may seem like a relic of the 18th century, but in some parts of the United States, you can still go to jail for not paying your gambling debt.</p>
<p>In October, a man in Alabama was sentenced to six months in jail for unpaid gambling debts. The victim, who had loaned the man money to gamble with, told reporters that he felt “like a sucker” after seeing his debtor sent to jail.</p>
<p>While debtors’ prisons have been outlawed in most of the United States since the 1830s, creditors can still get a court order requiring you to pay your gambling debt. If you don’t comply with the order, you could face contempt of court charges and even imprisonment.</p>
<p>So what should you do if you find yourself on the wrong end of a gambling debt? Here are a few tips:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Talk to your creditor. If you can’t afford to pay your gambling debt, try to negotiate a payment plan with your creditor. They may be willing to work with you if they believe you’re sincere about repaying what you owe.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Contact a lawyer. If faced with legal action over an unpaid gambling debt, it’s best to have legal representation. A lawyer can help you understand your rights and defenses under the law.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Seek financial assistance. There are many organizations that offer assistance to people who are struggling financially. If you can’t afford to pay your gambling debts, these organizations may be able to help.</p>
</li>
<li><p>File for bankruptcy protection. If all else fails, filing for bankruptcy may be your best option. This will allow you to discharge your gambling debts and start fresh financially.</p>
</li>

<h1 id="Tips-to-Avoid-Accumulating-Gambling-Debt"><a href="#Tips-to-Avoid-Accumulating-Gambling-Debt" class="headerlink" title="Tips to Avoid Accumulating Gambling Debt"></a>Tips to Avoid Accumulating Gambling Debt</h1><p>If you’re like most people, you enjoy a leisurely game of chance from time to time. Whether it’s betting on the ponies, playing the slots, or taking a chance on your favorite team, gambling can be a fun and exciting way to pass the time. But if you’re not careful, it can also be a costly way to lose your hard-earned money.</p>
<p>If you’re someone who likes to gamble, here are a few tips to help you avoid accumulating gambling debt:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Establish a budget and stick to it. Before you even step foot in a casino or racetrack, decide how much money you’re willing to risk and stick to that amount. Don’t let the adrenaline rush of gambling cause you to overspend on games that have little chance of winning.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Only gamble with money that you can afford to lose. This is another important rule for preventing gambling debt. Don’t use money set aside for bills or groceries to gamble with; only use funds that you can afford to lose without impacting your day-to-day life.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Have realistic expectations. Gambling is always risky, so don’t go into it expecting to win big every time. Be aware of the odds against you and accept that sometimes you will lose money. This way, if&#x2F;when you do lose, it won’t come as such a shock and won’t impact your finances as negatively.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Avoid temptation. If possible, try not to gamble in areas where it’s easy to get carried away (such as Las Vegas or Atlantic City). Instead, choose casinos or tracks that are smaller and less flashy, making it easier to stick to your budgeted amount.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Take breaks. Like any other type of addiction, gambling can be addictive and dangerous if not monitored properly. If you start feeling like you’re losing control or spending too much money, take a break from gambling altogether until you feel more in control again.</p>
</li>
</ol>
