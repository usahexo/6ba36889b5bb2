DOES THIS MEAN THE END OF CLASH OF GODS?"></a>WHEN DID BINIONS CASINO CLOSE? DOES THIS MEAN THE END OF CLASH OF GODS?</h1><p>The Binions casino closed in February of 2019, leaving many in the poker community wondering what this means for the future of Clash of Gods.</p>
<p>Clash of Gods is a popular poker tournament that has been held at the Binions casino for years. The tournament was canceled after the casino closed, and it is not clear if it will be held again.</p>
<p>Some people are speculating that the closure of the casino means the end of Clash of Gods. However, there is no evidence to support this claim.</p>
<p>It is possible that the tournament will be moved to another venue, or that it will be canceled altogether. Only time will tell.</p>
<h1 id="CLASH-OF-GODS-GAME-ON-HOLD-AFTER-BINIONS-CASINO-CLOSES-DOWN"><a href="#CLASH-OF-GODS-GAME-ON-HOLD-AFTER-BINIONS-CASINO-CLOSES-DOWN" class="headerlink" title="CLASH OF GODS GAME ON HOLD AFTER BINIONS CASINO CLOSES DOWN"></a>CLASH OF GODS GAME ON HOLD AFTER BINIONS CASINO CLOSES DOWN</h1><p>The much anticipated Clash of Gods game tournament at Binions Casino in Las Vegas has been postponed indefinitely after the casino unexpectedly closed its doors this week.</p>
<p>The closure of Binions Casino has caused a lot of upset among gamblers and casino staff alike, with many employees losing their jobs. The future of the casino remains uncertain, with rumours that it may be sold to another company.</p>
<p>The postponement of the Clash of Gods tournament has left many players disappointed. The tournament was expected to be one of the highlights of the gambling calendar, with top players from all over the world competing for a $1 million prize pool.</p>
<p>Some players have already started looking for other tournaments to enter, but most are just waiting for news about when or if the tournament will take place. There is no clear answer yet as to when or where the tournament will be held, but officials from Caesars Entertainment Corporation, which is organizing the event, say they are doing everything they can to find a new venue.</p>
<p>In a statement released this week, a spokesperson for Caesars Entertainment Corporation said: “We are deeply sorry for any inconvenience that this situation may have caused our players. We are doing everything we can to find a new venue and get the tournament back on track as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>The Clash of Gods tournament was originally scheduled to take place from April 21-24 at Binions Casino.</p>
<h1 id="BINIONS-CASINO-CLOSURE-RAISES-QUESTIONS-ABOUT-FUTURE-OF-CLASH-OF-GODS"><a href="#BINIONS-CASINO-CLOSURE-RAISES-QUESTIONS-ABOUT-FUTURE-OF-CLASH-OF-GODS" class="headerlink" title="BINIONS CASINO CLOSURE RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT FUTURE OF CLASH OF GODS"></a>BINIONS CASINO CLOSURE RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT FUTURE OF CLASH OF GODS</h1><p>On Monday, news broke that Binions Casino in downtown Las Vegas would be closing its doors for good on May 15th. The closure has sent ripples through the city’s casino industry, as well as the wider world of online gaming.</p>
<p>The news comes as a particular surprise given that Binions has been a fixture of the downtown landscape for over 80 years. The closure is all the more puzzling because it coincides with the debut of Clash of Gods, a new online casino that has been heavily marketed as a revitalization of the Las Vegas gaming scene.</p>
<p>Officials at Binions have not yet released a statement explaining the closure, but industry insiders are already speculating about the reasons behind it. Some believe that the casino may have been struggling financially, while others suggest that there may have been disagreements among management about how to move forward in light of Clash of Gods’ arrival.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason for the closure, it is certain to have a major impact on both Binions and Clash of Gods. For Binions, it means losing one of its most iconic properties; for Clash of Gods, it means potentially losing out on one of its main competition venues.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how both businesses adapt in the coming weeks and months. In particular, Clash of Gods will need to find a way to make up for the significant revenue that Binions was likely generating.</p>
<h1 id="CLASH-OF-GODS-GAME-MAY-BE-IN-JEOPARDY-FOLLOWING-BINIONS-CASINO-CLOSURE"><a href="#CLASH-OF-GODS-GAME-MAY-BE-IN-JEOPARDY-FOLLOWING-BINIONS-CASINO-CLOSURE" class="headerlink" title="CLASH OF GODS GAME MAY BE IN JEOPARDY FOLLOWING BINIONS CASINO CLOSURE"></a>CLASH OF GODS GAME MAY BE IN JEOPARDY FOLLOWING BINIONS CASINO CLOSURE</h1><p>The closure of the Binions casino in downtown Las Vegas may have dealt a fatal blow to the development of Clash of Gods, a new online slot game based on Norse mythology.</p>
<p>The $17 million game, which was being developed by local video game company PlaynGo, had been in production for over two years and was scheduled for release this summer. However, the closure of the casino has put the project on hold.</p>
<p>“We’re in a holding pattern right now,” said PlaynGo CEO Johan Tornqvist. “We’re waiting to see what happens with the casino.”</p>
<p>Binions closed its doors on March 14th after its owner, Galt Gaming, filed for bankruptcy. The closure left over 1,000 employees without jobs and put the future of other businesses that operate in the casino, including Clash of Gods, in doubt.</p>
<p>Galt Gaming is currently in negotiations with two potential buyers for the casino but no deal has been reached yet. If a deal is not reached soon, Clash of Gods may never see the light of day.</p>
<h1 id="BINIONS-CASINO-SHUTDOWN-HURTING-FREE-TO-PLAY-GAME-CLASH-OF-GODS"><a href="#BINIONS-CASINO-SHUTDOWN-HURTING-FREE-TO-PLAY-GAME-CLASH-OF-GODS" class="headerlink" title="BINIONS CASINO SHUTDOWN HURTING FREE-TO-PLAY GAME, CLASH OF GODS"></a>BINIONS CASINO SHUTDOWN HURTING FREE-TO-PLAY GAME, CLASH OF GODS</h1><p>The closure of Binions Casino in downtown Las Vegas is having a ripple effect on the free-to-play game, Clash of Gods. The game’s developer, EGO, has seen a decrease in active users since the casino closed its doors in early May.</p>
<p>EGO has been unable to determine the specific cause of the drop in users, but believes that the closure of Binions is a major contributing factor. Located just one block from EGO’s headquarters, the casino was a major player in the game’s user base.</p>
<p>Clash of Gods is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game that allows players to control mythological gods and warriors from different pantheons. The game has been downloaded over 5 million times and has generated over $100 million in revenue since its release in 2017.</p>
<p>In a statement released to the press, EGO CEO Amir Goldstein said “We are disappointed by the closure of Binions and its impact on our business. However, we remain committed to our players and will continue to develop new content and features for Clash of Gods.”</p>
<p>Clash of Gods is currently available on iOS and Android devices.</p>
