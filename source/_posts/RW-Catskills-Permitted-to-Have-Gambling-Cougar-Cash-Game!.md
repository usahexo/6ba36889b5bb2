#  How RW Catskills is Allowed to Have Gambling Facility!

In the Catskills, there are a few different types of gambling facilities. There are racinos, which are combined racetracks and casinos; Indian casinos, which are operated by Native American tribes; and commercial casinos, which are run by private companies.

The full legalization of casino-style gambling in New York came in 2004 with the passage of a statewide referendum authorizing Las Vegas-style commercial casinos. Seven years later, in 2011, the state Legislature granted racinos the authority to operate full-scale table games and slot machines.RW Catskills is located in Monticello, NY and is one of those racinos.

The company that owns RW Catskills, Empire Resorts Inc., won the license to build and operate the facility in a 2006 bidding process. The $340 million project broke ground in 2009 and officially opened its doors on July 2, 2010. RW Catskills has since become one of the most popular tourist destinations in Sullivan County.

The idea for a gaming facility at RW Catskills actually began back in 2004, when New York voters passed a referendum authorizing casino gambling in the state. At the time, Empire Resorts was just getting into the gaming business with its purchase of Monticello Raceway. When it became clear that the new law would allow for full-scale table games and slot machines at racinos, Empire Resorts went all-in on its bid for the license to build and operate RW Catskills.

Construction on RW Catskills began in 2009 and it officially opened its doors on July 2, 2010. The project cost $340 million to build and it was funded largely by debt. In fact, Empire Resorts has been struggling financially ever since it opened RW Catskills. Back in 2014, Moody’s Investor Services downgraded Empire Resort’s credit rating from B3 to Caa1 due to its high debt load.

Despite its financial struggles, RW Catskills remains one of the most popular tourist destinations in Sullivan County. In fact, over 1 million people visit each year! The facility features a 24/7 casino with 1,600 slot machines and 66 table games as well as a harness racing track with live horse racing throughout the year. There’s also a hotel with 300 rooms and suites, several restaurants, and a lounge overlooking the track.
