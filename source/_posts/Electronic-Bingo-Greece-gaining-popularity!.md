In a recent development, the amount of money gambled on electronic bingo in Greece has hit a new high! Indeed, figures from the country’s Central Bank show that Greeks have wagered an astonishing €1.5 billion ($1.7 billion) on the game in just the first six months of 2018.

In fact, according to figures from the Bank of Greece, over 60% of all money wagered on bingo in Greece in 2018 was placed online. This compares to just 38% in 2013, highlighting just how rapidly this form of gambling is growing in popularity.
