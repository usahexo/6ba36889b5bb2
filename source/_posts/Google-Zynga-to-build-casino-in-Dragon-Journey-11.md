#  Casino in progress at Google Zynga's Dragon Journey 11

Casino in progress at Google Zynga's Dragon Journey 11. Shares of Google (GOOGL) were up 0.4% to $1,070.98 in premarket trading Friday after news that the search giant is teaming up with social gaming company Zynga (ZNGA) on a new casino game called "Dragon Journey 11."

Details of the game are scant, but both companies say it will be available soon on mobile devices. The move underscores Google's renewed interest in gaming--an industry that has been dominated by Facebook (FB) and its subsidiary, Zynga, for years.

Shares of Facebook were up 1.5% to $181.07 in premarket trading Friday. The two companies are now locked in a battle for users as they migrate to mobile devices from personal computers.

Google is also said to be working on a new version of its Android operating system that would make it easier for developers to create games. The update, code-named "Lollipop," is expected to be unveiled next month at the company's annual developer conference, Google I/O.

#  Construction of Casino Dragon Journey 11 well underway

Construction of Casino Dragon Journey 11 is now officially underway, marking another milestone for the popular casino resort. Situated on the banks of the Nam Ou River, the new casino will be larger and more spectacular than any of its predecessors.

According to project developers, the new casino will be themed around a dragon journey, with each floor representing a different stage in the legendary creature's life. Guests will be able to enjoy stunning views of the river as they gamble and dine in style.

In addition to a wide range of gambling options, including slots, table games and poker, the new casino will also feature a luxury hotel overlooking the river. There will be over 200 rooms and suites available, as well as a range of restaurants and bars.

The construction project is expected to take 18 months to complete, with the new casino opening its doors to guests in early 2020. In the meantime, visitors can enjoy all that Casino Dragon Journey 10 has to offer, including its world-class gaming facilities and luxurious accommodations.
