#  Cougar Casino Begins Operating With No License 

Michigan's online gambling regulator, the Commission on Gaming, announced that it has revoked the license of Cougar Casino. The casino continued to operate, however, with no license.

Cougar Casino is owned by Evolution Gaming Ltd., a Malta-based company. The company is one of the largest and most respected providers of live dealer gaming services in the world.

According to the Commission on Gaming's report, Cougar Casino "failed to demonstrate good corporate governance practices" and "failed to cooperate with the commission during the investigation."

In a statement released to media, Evolution Gaming Ltd. said that it was "disappointed" with the decision of the commission and that it plans to "vigorously pursue all available legal remedies."

The company also said that it believes it has "acted in good faith at all times."
