#  What is the company's history and how did it come to be in its current state?

The company’s history can be traced back to 2010 when two friends, Laurent and Florian, decided to start a business together. At the time, both were working in the advertising industry but were looking for a new challenge. They quickly realized that there was an opportunity in the market to create a digital agency that specialized in social media marketing.

They started out by renting a small office in Paris and started recruiting their first employees. Within a year, they had grown to a team of 10 people and were starting to win some major contracts from clients in France and abroad.

In 2012, they decided to take things to the next level and raised €1 million from investors to help them expand their business. This allowed them to open new offices in London and Berlin and recruit even more talented engineers and marketers.

Over the next few years, the company continued to grow at an impressive rate. In 2017, they reached a milestone of 300 employees and had generated over €25 million in revenue. They continue to grow today and are now one of the leading digital agencies in Europe.

Some companies also make money by providing licensing and intellectual property rights to other companies. Finally, a company can make money by going into business with another company, and then splitting the profits.

#  Who are the company's biggest competitors?

There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the company's competitors will vary depending on its industry and sector. However, some of the most common competitors in various industries include:

In the technology sector, companies like Apple, Google, and Microsoft are often major competitors.

In the automotive sector, companies like Ford and General Motors are typically major rivals.

In the retail sector, companies like Walmart and Target are typically seen as the biggest competitors.

As can be seen, it's important for a company to understand who its major competitors are, as competing against them head-to-head will be critical for success.

#  What is the company's future outlook?

There is no one definitive answer to this question. The future of any company depends on a variety of factors, including the industry in which it operates, the economy, and the company's own strategy and execution.

That said, there are some general trends that could have an impact on the future of most companies. For example, technology is evolving rapidly and changing the way businesses operate. This could create opportunities for some companies and challenges for others. Additionally, consumer behavior is changing, with people increasingly expecting value for their money. Companies that can't keep up with these changes may find themselves at a disadvantage.

In order to get a sense for a company's future outlook, it's important to look at all of these factors and assess how well the company is positioned to capitalize on them.
