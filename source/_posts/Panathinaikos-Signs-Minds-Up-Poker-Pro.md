#  Panathinaikos Picks Up Third Straight Win, Thanks to Minds Up

In a game that pitted first against second in the Greek basketball league, Panathinaikos picked up its third consecutive win, thanks to some hot shooting from downtown.

Facing stiff competition from Olympiacos Piraeus, Panathinaikos was able to come away with the narrow victory, thanks in part to some timely three-point shooting. Olympiacos had won its last two games by an average of nearly 30 points heading into Monday night's matchup, but Panathinaikos was firing on all cylinders and was able to keep it close.

The game came down to the wire, with Olympiacos holding a one-point lead with just over two minutes remaining. But Panathinaikos was not going down without a fight, and heated up from beyond the arc to retake the lead. Thanks to some clutch shooting late in the game, Panathinaikos was able to hold on for the victory.

Mindaugas Kuzminskas led the way for Panathinaikos with 23 points on 8-of-12 shooting from the floor, including 6-of-8 shooting from three-point range. Marcus Thornton added 20 points off the bench for Panathinaikos, while Nick Calathes chipped in 18 points and 11 assists. Georgios Printezis led Olympiacos with 27 points and 10 rebounds.

With the victory, Panathinaikos improves to 16-4 on the season, while Olympiacos falls to 16-5.
