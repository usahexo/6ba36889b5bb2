#  The Old-School Game is Making a Comeback in Online Casino

The online casino industry is booming, and it seems like every day a new gaming site is popping up. With so much competition in the market, these sites are constantly trying to one-up each other by offering bigger and better bonuses, more games, and unique features.

One trend that we're seeing in the online casino world is a resurgence of old-school games. These classic favorites are being brought back to life by innovative designers who have breathed new life into them with flashy graphics and exciting bonus rounds.

If you're looking for a retro gaming experience with all the bells and whistles of today's online casinos, here are five old-school games that you should check out:

#1) Blackjack

Blackjack is one of the most popular casino games in the world, and it's no surprise that it's also one of the most popular old-school games. This fast-paced card game can be played at any online casino, and there are variations of it available to suit any player's style.

If you're new to blackjack, we recommend trying out one of the many free versions available online. Once you've got the hang of it, head over to an online casino and play for real money. You could stand to win big if you hit blackjack!

#2) Roulette

Roulette is another classic casino game that has been around for centuries. This spinning wheel game offers plenty of excitement and anticipation, and there are many betting options available to suit any budget.

To play roulette at an online casino, all you need is a few dollars (or pounds or euros) and a bit of luck! Start with a small bet and see how it goes – if things are going your way, keep increasing your bets until you hit the jackpot.

#3) Video Poker

Video poker is a favorite among experienced gamers because it offers excellent winning potential when played correctly. This game is based on five-card draw poker, but instead of playing against other players, you're playing against the machine. This means that you can't lose – as long as you make good choices!

Video poker can be found at almost any online casino, and there are variations of it to suit every type of player. The key to winning big is to make sure you understand all the rules before you start playing – luckily, this isn't too difficult thanks to all the great resources available on the internet.

#  Baccarat Returns to its Roots with Microgaming Casino Version

The modern casino game of Baccarat can be traced back to around the 15th century, and it’s thought to have originated in either France or Italy. The game enjoyed a period of great popularity in the 19th century, but then somewhat fell out of favour. In more recent times, however, Baccarat has made something of a comeback, thanks in no small part to its incorporation into online casinos.

Microgaming is one of the leading software providers for online casinos, and they’ve just released a new version of Baccarat that harkens back to the game’s origins. Dubbed “Classic Baccarat”, this new game eschews many of the bells and whistles of more modern versions, instead focusing on delivering an authentic Baccarat experience.

One of the key features of Classic Baccarat is its use of real Playing Cards decks. This means that players will get a truly immersive experience, as they can see and feel the cards being dealt out on the table. The gameplay is also kept deliberately simple, with just three betting options available – banker, player or tie.

This stripped-back approach may not appeal to all players, but it does provide a true test of skill and luck. There are no bonus rounds or special features to distract you from the main action, so you’ll need to make absolutely sure that your bets are well placed if you want to come out ahead.

Classic Baccarat is currently available at a number of Microgaming-powered online casinos, including 32Red and Jackpot City. If you’re looking for a truly authentic Baccarat experience, then be sure to check it out!
