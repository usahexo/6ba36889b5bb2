#  What are some of the best layouts for Top Builder Hall Level 4 bases?

There are a variety of layouts that can be used for Builder Hall Level 4 bases, but some of the best ones include:

1. A ring of walls with cannons in the middle - this is a relatively simple layout that can be effective in preventing enemy troops from getting too close to your base.

2. A circular design with turrets at the edge - this layout is a bit more complex, but it can be very effective in stopping enemy attackers.

3. An "L" shaped layout with turrets at the corners - this layout is also effective in stopping enemies from getting too close to your base.

4. A "T" shaped layout with turrets at the ends - this layout is very versatile and can be used in a number of different situations.

5. A maze-like layout with lots of walls and turrets - this is a more complex layout that can be difficult for enemies to navigate, but it requires more time and effort to set up correctly.

#  How can you beat the new Air Sweeper?

The new Air Sweeper in Clash of Clans is a powerful tool that can help you defeat your opponents. However, there are some strategies that you can use to beat it.

The first thing to consider is placement. You should place the Air Sweeper in a central location so that it can cover as much of the map as possible. You should also make sure that it is not surrounded by buildings, as this will limit its range.

Another thing to consider is timing. You should attack when the Air Sweeper is down or when its range is blocked. Additionally, you should use a large number of units to overwhelm the Air Sweeper.

Finally, you should use troops that are immune to air attacks. This includes Healers, Giants, and other large units.

#  What are some of the best ways to use your X-Bows and Eagle Artillery?

There are a few different ways that you can use your X-Bows and Eagle Artillery to devastating effect. One way is to position them in the back line and use them to take down enemy troops from a distance. Their long range makes them excellent for taking out enemy archers and other troops that are positioned in the back line.

Another way to use your X-Bows and Eagle Artillery is to position them in the front line. This will allow you to inflict heavy damage on the enemy's front line troops, causing them to retreat. Additionally, using your X-Bows and Eagle Artillery in this way will help to protect your own troops from the front line enemies.

Finally, you can also use your X-Bows and Eagle Artillery as support troops. This means positioning them behind your main troops so that they can provide support by attacking the enemies from behind. This will help to prevent the enemies from getting too close to your main troops, which could result in their defeat.

#  How can you protect your Crown Towers from Air Attacks?

There are a couple of things that you can do in order to protect your Crown Towers from air attacks. The first is to make sure that you have plenty of Tesla towers, and the second is to make sure that you have troops stationed on the ground near the towers.

The Tesla tower is a great way to protect your Crown Towers from air attacks, as it will fire off bolts of electricity at any enemy planes that come near. You should make sure to place plenty of these towers around your towers, so that they are well protected.

You should also make sure to station some troops on the ground near the towers. This will help to protect them from ground attacks, as well as air attacks. If there are no troops on the ground, then the enemy planes will be able to fly right past the towers and damage them.

#  What other strategies work well against the new Air Sweeper?

The new Air Sweeper in Clash of Clans is a powerful tool that can easily take down air troops. However, there are several strategies that can still be successful against it.

One strategy is to use a large number of ground troops. The Air Sweeper has a low fire rate, so it can’t take down many troops at once. If you use a large number of ground troops, the Air Sweeper will be overwhelmed and won’t be able to stop your attack.

Another strategy is to use air troops. The Air Sweeper is most effective against ground troops, so if you use air troops, you can avoid its damage. Additionally, air troops are immune to the Air Sweeper’s knockback effect, so they can easily destroy it.

Finally, you can use ranged troops. Ranged troops are immune to the Air Sweeper’s knockback effect, and they can fire from a safe distance. This makes them ideal for attacking Air Sweepers.
