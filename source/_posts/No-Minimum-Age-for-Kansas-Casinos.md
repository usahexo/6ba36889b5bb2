#  No Minimum Age for Kansas Casinos

Kansas casinos no minimum age requirement for casino gaming has become a popular destination for tourists and gamers from neighboring states. Nearby states have a minimum legal gambling age of 21, while there is no such requirement in Kansas. The allure of easy access to casinos has drawn many people to the state, including underage gamblers.

The legality of underage gambling at Kansas casinos has come into question, as state law does not clearly define when someone is considered to be an adult. Two recent cases in which minors were caught gambling at a casino have stirred up the debate over whether or not the state should set a minimum age for casino gaming.

In one case, a 17-year-old was caught gambling at a casino in Wichita. The minor was issued a citation and released to his parents. In the other case, a 19-year-old was arrested after he was caught cheating at blackjack in a casino in Dodge City. The young man was taken into custody and later released on bond.

Casino operators argue that setting a minimum age would be discriminatory, as it would prevent minors from participating in lawful activities at casinos along with adults. However, opponents of underage gambling say that casinos are not suitable environments for minors and that the state should do more to protect them from developing addictions to gambling.

A bill that would have set the minimum age for casino gaming at 18 failed to make it out of committee during the most recent legislative session. The issue is likely to be debated again next year, as lawmakers continue to search for ways to address the growing popularity of Kansas casinos.
