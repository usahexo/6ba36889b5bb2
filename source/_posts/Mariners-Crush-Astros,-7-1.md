#  Mariners Crush Astros, 7-1

Houston Astros' starting pitcher Dallas Keuchel had a miserable night on the mound Wednesday, giving up seven runs - four of them earned - in five innings of work as the Seattle Mariners rolled to a 7-1 victory.

The loss drops the defending World Series champions to 11-17 on the season and 6.5 games back of the Mariners in the American League West standings.

Seattle (18-11) got on the board in the top of the first inning when designated hitter Nelson Cruz belted a three-run home run off of Keuchel. Catcher Mike Zunino added an RBI double in the third, and shortstop Jean Segura drove in two more with a bases-loaded single in the fifth to make it 7-0.

Houston (11-17) finally got on the board in the bottom of the sixth inning when third baseman Alex Bregman hit an RBI double off of Mariners reliever Edwin Diaz. Astros outfielder George Springer followed with a solo home run to left field to make it 7-1, but that would be all they could muster on a night when their usually stout pitching staff was roughed up by Seattle's bats.

Cruz led Seattle's offensive onslaught against Keuchel, finishing 2 for 4 with four RBIs. Segura was 3 for 5 with two RBIs, and Zunino was 2 for 4 with two RBIs.

Mariners starter James Paxton (2-1) picked up the win, allowing just one run on six hits over six innings of work. He struck out nine and didn't walk a batter. Diaz got credit for his fourth save after pitching a scoreless ninth inning.

<h2>Nelson Cruises as Mariners Win Seventh Straight</h2>

The Seattle Mariners cruised to their seventh consecutive victory on Sunday, defeating the Texas Rangers 7-1. Nelson Cruz led the offense with a home run and three RBI, while Robinson Cano added two hits and an RBI. Felix Hernandez picked up the win, allowing just one run over six innings pitched.

The Mariners have now won 12 of their last 13 games and have pulled within 2.5 games of the first place Los Angeles Angels in the American League West. They will look to continue their winning streak when they open a three-game series against the Detroit Tigers on Tuesday night.

#  Seattle's Offense Comes Alive in Houston

There was a lot of anticipation in Seattle leading up to their Week 6 matchup against the Houston Texans. The Seahawks had been struggling offensively, but many believed that the return of running back Chris Carson would be the spark they needed.

And spark they did. Seattle put up 36 points against a tough Texans defense, with Carson leading the way with 116 yards on the ground. Russell Wilson had his best game of the season, throwing for three touchdowns and no interceptions.

Carson's return was not the only surprise for Seattle. Wide receiver David Moore, who had just two receptions for nine yards all season prior to this game, caught four passes for 113 yards and two touchdowns.

"It was great to finally get out there and make some plays," said Moore. "The offense has been struggling a bit lately, so it was nice to contribute."

With their offense finally clicking, the Seahawks will look to build on this momentum as they head into their Week 7 matchup against the Los Angeles Rams.

#  Mariners Pound Out 17 Hits in Victory Over Astros

The Seattle Mariners pounded out 17 hits on their way to a 9-1 victory over the Houston Astros.

Robinson Cano got the Mariners offense started in the first inning with a two-run homer. Kyle Seager and Nelson Cruz also homered for the Mariners.

Erasmo Ramirez got the win, pitching 6 innings and allowing just one run.

Cano finished the game 3 for 5 with 3 RBIs. Seager was 2 for 4 with 2 RBIs, and Cruz was 2 for 5 with 2 RBIs.

The Mariners will look to keep the momentum going when they take on the Astros again on Wednesday.

#  Seattle Continues Dominance of Houston With 7-1 Win

The Seattle Mariners (56-31) continued their dominance over the Houston Astros (41-47) with a 7-1 win on Wednesday night. The Mariners have now won six out of the seven meetings between the two teams this season.

Houston starter Lance McCullers Jr. (5-6) was roughed up in his shortest start of the season, lasting just three innings and giving up six runs on eight hits. Seattle starter Felix Hernandez (8-6) was sharp, allowing just one run on five hits in six innings of work.

The Mariners jumped out to an early lead, scoring two runs in the first inning off of McCullers Jr. Robinson Cano led off the game with a double and scored on a single by Jean Segura. Nelson Cruz then hit a two-run home run to make it 3-0 Seattle.

Houston got on the board in the third inning when Carlos Correa hit a solo home run, but Seattle answered back with four more runs in the bottom of the inning. Segura drove in another run with a double, and Hernandez later came home on an error by Houston outfielder Jake Marisnick.

Seattle put the game away with three more runs in the seventh inning. Kyle Seager hit a solo home run, and Mike Zunino and Denard Span both drove in runs with singles.

The Mariners remain atop of the AL West division, 4 1/2 games ahead of the second place Oakland Athletics. They will next face off against the Astros again on Friday night in Houston.
