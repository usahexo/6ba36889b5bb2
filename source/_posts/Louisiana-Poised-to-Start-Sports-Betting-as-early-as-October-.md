#  Louisiana Poised to Start Sports Betting as early as October 

Louisiana is hoping to join the gambling fray by legalizing sports betting as early as October. 

The state has been anxious to get into the sports betting market since the US Supreme Court struck down a federal ban on the activity in 2018. Louisiana joins a number of other states who have already legalized and started taking sports bets, including Nevada, Delaware, New Jersey, and West Virginia. 

Governor John Bel Edwards is expected to sign the legislation into law next month, with officials saying that regulations will be in place by October. The bill authorizes both land-based and mobile sports betting in Louisiana. Sports betting would be taxed at 10 percent of gross gaming revenue. 

The regulations will require bettors to be at least 21 years old and will prohibit people from placing bets while drunk or high. State officials are still working out the details of how the system will work, including how much of a cut casinos will get from sports betting. 

Louisiana is expecting to bring in $48 million in tax revenue from sports betting in its first year. That’s modest compared to other states – Nevada brought in nearly $1 billion in 2018 – but it’s still a good chunk of change for a state that’s looking for new sources of revenue. 

Opponents of gambling argue that it can lead to addiction and other social problems, but supporters say it can be a valuable source of tax revenue and can help create jobs. With states increasingly looking for new sources of revenue, it’s likely that more states will legalize sports betting in the coming years.

#  Louisiana Legislature Passes Bill to Allow Sports Betting 

The Louisiana Legislature has passed a bill that will allow for sports betting in the state.

 Governor John Bel Edwards is expected to sign the measure into law, making Louisiana the fifth state in the nation to allow sports betting.

The legislation was proposed by Representative Dudley Bonnay and would allow for both online and land-based sports betting.

It is unclear at this time when exactly the sports betting will be available in Louisiana, but it is expected to launch later this year.

#  Louisiana Officials Announce Plans for Sports Betting Operation 

Louisiana is among the states that are preparing for the introduction of legalized sports betting. Officials in the state have announced that they will operate a sports betting site that will be available to residents and visitors.

The site will be operated by the Louisiana Lottery, and it is expected to launch in early 2019. Bettors will be able to place bets on a variety of sporting events, including college and professional football, basketball, baseball, and hockey.

The Lottery has not yet released any details about the site, such as its name or how people will be able to access it. However, officials say that more information will be released in the coming weeks.

Louisiana is one of several states that are moving forward with plans for sports betting following the Supreme Court's decision in May to overturn a federal ban on the practice. The Court ruled that states are free to legalize sports betting if they choose to do so.

Since then, several states have moved to establish regulations for sports betting operations. In New Jersey, which was one of the first states to legalize sports betting, bettors can place wagers at casinos and racetracks, as well as through mobile apps.

Several other states, including Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Mississippi, have also launched sports betting operations since the Supreme Court ruling.

#  Louisiana to Launch Sports Betting in Time for NFL Season 
BATON ROUGE, LA - Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards has announced that the state will offer legalized sports betting in time for the NFL season. This makes Louisiana the first southern state to offer sports betting.

Sports betting will be available at casinos and racetracks across the state. bets can be placed on NFL, NCAA, MLB, NBA, and NHL games.

"We are pleased to partner with the state of Louisiana on this initiative," said casino operator Harrah's New Orleans President and CEO Eric Hopton. "We know that our customers will enjoy having this option available to them."

The NFL season kicks off on September 6th, so Louisiana residents can start betting on their favorite teams soon.

#  Louisiana set to open sports betting operations in coming weeks

Louisiana is preparing to open up sports betting operations in the coming weeks, following the Supreme Court’s decision in May to overturn the federal ban on sports betting.

State officials have been meeting with gaming operators and working out the details of how sports betting will be implemented in Louisiana. The first casinos are expected to start offering sports betting within the next few weeks, with other venues likely to follow suit later in the year.

The legalization of sports betting is expected to generate millions of dollars in revenue for Louisiana, as people bet on everything from football and baseball games to horse racing and boxing matches.

“This has been a long time coming,” said Governor John Bel Edwards. “And we are excited to get started with this new form of entertainment that will bring jobs and economic development to our state.”

In addition to the revenue generated by sports betting, officials expect it to create hundreds of new jobs in the casino industry. Louisiana has long been a center of gambling activity, with casinos located in Baton Rouge, New Orleans, and other parts of the state.

The legalization of sports betting is also seen as a way to help combat problem gambling, as people will now have another option for spending their money. Officials say they will be monitoring gambling patterns carefully to ensure that no one gets into trouble.

Sports betting is already popular in many parts of the world, and there is evidence that it can be a healthy form of entertainment for people who like to gamble. In addition to providing revenue for states, it can also help create jobs and boost tourism.
