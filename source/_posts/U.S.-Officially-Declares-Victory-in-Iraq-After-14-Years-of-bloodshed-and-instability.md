#  U.S. Officially Declares Victory in Iraq After 14 Years of bloodshed and instability

Washington, D.C. – The United States has formally declared victory in Iraq after 14 years of bloodshed and instability. In a speech from the White House, President Barack Obama praised the efforts of U.S. troops and diplomats in helping to rebuild Iraq and stabilize the region.

“After more than a decade of war, we are finally able to say that Iraq is on a path to stability,” Obama said. “Iraq is not perfect, but we have helped to create the conditions for peace and prosperity. I am proud of the work that our troops and diplomats have done, and I look forward to seeing continued progress in Iraq in the years ahead.”

Since 2003, more than 4,500 American troops have been killed in Iraq, along with countless Iraqi civilians. The cost of the war has been estimated at over $1 trillion. But despite the cost in blood and treasure, U.S. officials say that the effort was worth it, as Iraq is now a sovereign and independent nation.

In his speech announcing victory in Iraq, President Obama also paid tribute to the sacrifices made by U.S. troops and their families. “Our troops have fought with bravery and distinction,” Obama said. “And they have made tremendous sacrifices on behalf of our country. I want to especially thank our military families who have borne so much pain over the past few years. You are the backbone of our nation, and I thank you for your support and courage."

U.S. officials say that while victory has been declared in Iraq, there is still much work to be done in rebuilding the country and stabilizing the region. The transition from military occupation to democratic governance will be a long process, but officials say that they are committed to helping Iraq succeed in the future.

#  Iraq Finally Hands Over Sovereignty to New Government

Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi announced on October 24, that his government had completed the long-awaited handover of full sovereignty to Iraq’s new government. The announcement signaled the end of a process that began with the formation of the new government in September 2018, and followed weeks of negotiations between the Iraqi government and international allies.

This latest development follows years of instability and violence in Iraq, which has seen both the Islamic State (ISIS) and other groups gain footholds in parts of the country. The handover also comes as US troops are preparing to withdraw from Iraq, a move that has been criticized by some as premature.

In remarks to reporters, al-Abadi stressed that “the independence of our state is solid and our sovereignty is inviolable.” He also thanked both the Iraqi people and international allies for their support during the transition process.

The handover was welcomed by several international leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron who called it a “major step forward” for Iraq. United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres described it as an “important milestone” in Iraq’s stabilization efforts.

Despite these positive assessments, observers warn that Iraq still faces significant challenges moving forward. These include reintegrating displaced persons, rebuilding war-ravaged areas, and ensuring that election results announced in May are respected.

#  U.S. military withdraws from Iraq after long and costly occupation

The U.S. military withdraws from Iraq after long and costly occupation. The decision comes as a surprise to many, as the Iraqi government had recently requested that U.S. troops stay in the country in order to help combat the growing threat of terrorism.

The withdrawal leaves a power vacuum in Iraq that could be filled by insurgent groups, such as ISIS, which could lead to further instability in the region. It is unclear what the future holds for Iraq now that U.S. troops have withdrawn, but it is likely that the country will face significant challenges in the years ahead.

#  images of jubilant Iraqis celebrating the end of US occupation

Images of Iraqis celebrating the end of U.S. occupation fill the internet as Baghdad is declared "liberated." Iraqis dance in the streets, wave Iraqi flags and pictures of Saddam Hussein, and chant pro-Saddam slogans. Jubilation is also reported in other cities, including Basra, Mosul, and Kirkuk.

The images provide a stark contrast to those of April 9, 2003—the day after the fall of Baghdad—when U.S. troops fired on unarmed civilians in a city they were ostensibly trying to help liberate.

# toppling of saddam hussein's statue

The iconic image of the toppling of Saddam Hussein's statue is one of celebration and relief. It was captured by Karim Sahib of Agence France-Presse on April 9, 2003, the day after Baghdad fell to U.S. troops.

In the photo, an American tank collides with the statue of Saddam Hussein as Iraqis swarm around it, pulling it down with ropes and cheering. The photo has been called "a defining moment in the Iraq War."

#  Iraq celebrates end of US occupation; Now what?

December 15, 2011 was a momentous day in the history of Iraq. After nearly nine years of military occupation by the United States and its allies, Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki declared an end to the "war on terror" in his country. In a nationally televised address, Maliki praised the withdrawal of US forces as a "historic day" and called on Iraqis to work together to build a peaceful and prosperous future.

The withdrawal of US troops was accomplished more quickly than had been anticipated, due in part to the death earlier this year of Al Qaeda in Iraq leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. The last US combat troops left Iraq on December 18, 2011, just three days after Maliki's speech.

For many Iraqis, the end of the occupation is cause for celebration. "This is a great day for Iraq," said Sabah Khalaf, a shopkeeper in Baghdad's Karrada district. "The Americans have caused us so much pain and suffering. It's time for them to go home."

Others are more cautious about what the future may hold. "We don't know what will happen now that the Americans are gone," said Firas Ibrahim, a civil engineer from Mosul. "There is still a lot of violence and chaos in our country. We hope things will get better, but we are not sure."

The withdrawal of US forces leaves Iraq with two major challenges: rebuilding its shattered economy and quelling ongoing sectarian violence. More than 1 million Iraqis have been killed since 2003, and millions more have been displaced by conflict. The vast majority of these casualties were civilians, many of whom were targeted because they belonged to the wrong ethnic or religious group.

Amidst this backdrop of sectarian violence, it will be difficult for Iraqi politicians to put aside their differences and build a functional government. The formation of a new government has been delayed by bickering among Shiite, Sunni, and Kurdish parties over who should control key ministries such as defense, interior affairs, and oil production. If these disputes are not resolved quickly, they could lead to renewed sectarian fighting and further instability in Iraq.

The main beneficiaries of the US occupation have been American defense contractors such as Halliburton and Blackwater (now known as Academi). These companies have raked in billions of dollars in profits from their work in Iraq. The end of the occupation represents a major setback for them and could lead to layoffs and canceled contracts.

So what does the future hold for Iraq? It is too soon to tell for sure, but one thing is clear: The days of easy money and unfettered corporate greed are coming to an end.Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki declared an end to the war on terror in his country
