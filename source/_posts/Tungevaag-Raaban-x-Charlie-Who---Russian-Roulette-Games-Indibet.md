#  Tungevaag Raaban and Charlie Who - Collaboration Different Roulette Games

Norwegian EDM producers Tungevaag Raaban and Charlie Who have combined their unique talents to create a new roulette game. The two musicians agreed to work together in early 2018, and the resulting game is called "Different Roulette".

The premise of the game is quite simple - players place bets on numbers, and if their number comes up they win. However, there are a few twists that make the game more interesting. Firstly, players can bet on colours as well as numbers, and secondly, some of the squares on the board contain multipliers. This means that players can win big if they manage to hit a multiplier square.

The two producers have already released a teaser video for the game, which can be seen below. It's clear from the video that they have put a lot of thought into creating an engaging and exciting experience.

Tungevaag Raaban has commented on the collaboration, saying that it was "really fun" to work with Charlie Who. He added that they had very different ideas about how the game should work, but that they eventually managed to agree on a common vision.

Charlie Who echoed these sentiments, stating that it was great to work with Tungevaag Raaban and see his ideas come to life. He also emphasized the importance of making sure that the game is fun and exciting for players.

Different Roulette is currently in development, but is expected to be released in 2019. In the meantime, you can watch the teaser video below and get a sneak peak at what's in store.
