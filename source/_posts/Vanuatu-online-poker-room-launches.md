# Vanuatu online poker room launches

A new online poker room has just launched in Vanuatu. The poker room, which is named Poker Vanuatu, is the latest venture of the TPA Group, a Vanuatu-based company that owns and operates a number of online gaming sites.

The Poker Vanuatu poker room is powered by the popular 888poker software, and offers both cash games and tournaments. There are plenty of Sit & Go tournaments available, with buy-ins ranging from VUV 10 (about $1 USD) to VUV 1,000 (about $100 USD). The main event of the week is the Sunday Special tournament, which has a buy-in of VUV 500 (about $50 USD) and pays out a guaranteed prize pool of VUV 10,000 (about $1,000 USD).

Poker Vanuatu offers players the option to play in either US dollars or Vanuatu vatus. The vatus are worth about one tenth of a US dollar, so playing in vatus gives players a little bit more flexibility when it comes to choosing stakes.

The TPA Group is Excited to Launch Its Latest Venture: PokerVanuatu
commented TPA Group CEO Philippe Germond. "This new poker room will offer high quality gameplay experience with some great promotions and giveaways on offer."

PokerVanuatu is not just another average online poker room. This site has been specifically designed for the people of Vanuatu with their best interests at heart. Players can enjoy playing against others from around the world in a safe and friendly environment.

# Vanuatu GPI rankings released

The results of the 2018 global peace index (GPI) have just been released, with Vanuatu ranking as the most peaceful country in the south pacific. The island nation ranked 116th out of 163 countries overall, with a GPI score of 2.613.

This is the third year in a row that Vanuatu has topped the regional rankings, thanks to its strong performance in the categories of safety and security, militarization, and refugees and IDPs.Vanuatu also scored well for its lack of terrorist incidents and low levels of organized crime.

The only category where Vanuatu fared poorly was in political instability, which was rated as “high”. This was due largely to the uncertain political situation surrounding last year’s presidential election. However, since then there have been no major incidents or protests, so it is hoped that this rating will improve in next year’s index.

Other South Pacific countries that performed well include New Zealand (ranked 3rd), Fiji (12th), and Australia (17th). Tonga (51st) and Solomon Islands (57th) were also among the top 50 nations.

At the other end of the scale, Somalia was once again found to be the world’s most dangerous country, followed by Syria, Afghanistan, and Iraq.
